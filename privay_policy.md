DATA PRIVACY POLICY 

1. Rationale for the Privacy Policy


Key to our business
A wide variety of people
Sina Consult considers the fair and lawful treatment of personal information as key to its business and a prerequisite for the achievement of its strategic aims.

Sina Consult needs to process information about a wide variety of people in order to conduct its business, including past, present & future:

. Customers (students);

. Employees, other workers & pensioners;

. Suppliers; and

. Business contacts.

Compliant privacy practices are a key element of corporate governance and accountability. This Policy sets requirements relating to the way Sina Consult will
collect, handle, store, share, use and dispose of (“process”) information about people (“personal information”) to ensure

. we comply with relevant privacy and data protection laws around the world,

. we are meeting the expectations of our customers and employees; and

. in order to mitigate the following Level 2 Principal Risk:

Failure to comply with data protection/privacy laws & regulations including failure to: make notifications and obtain necessary authorisations; collect, 
use & protect the information of our customers and employees appropriately; and to implement processes & procedures for responding to subject access requests.

Processing personal information

Level 2 Principal Risk

Definition of personal information

Personal information includes all information about people, including visual images or expressions of opinion, recorded in electronic format (e.g. in databases, in Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, in email, voice recordings, etc.) and all information about people recorded in structured hard copy filing systems (e.g. personnel files). In short, any information from which an individual can be identified.
Some personal information may be classified as ’sensitive’ in some jurisdictions and generally stricter rules apply. This may include, but is not limited to, information relating to an individual’s:

. race or ethnicity,

. political opinions,

. religious beliefs or similar beliefs,

. membership of a trade union,

. physical or mental health or condition,

. sexual orientation,

. commission or alleged commission of any offence,

. social security number,

. genetic data.


2. Scope of the Policy

This policy applies to:

(i) all The Consult and Functions within the Sina Consult;

(ii) all Sina Consult employees and workers, including staff of any

subsidiary in which Sina Consult has a controlling interest, as well as agency workers, consultants and contractors, irrespective of their location, 
function, grade or standing (‘employees’).

The above are collectively referred to in this document as ‘The Consult’ and/or ‘Employees’.

This policy does not apply to employees of Third Parties (non-consolidated entities). However, by agreement between the policy owner and the 
Sina Consult Accountable Executive/Relationship Manager for a Third Party, specific control requirements incorporated within this policy may 
be applied to a Third Party. In such cases, obtaining the agreement of the Third Party to the control requirement(s) and the monitoring/oversight 
of the effective operation of the related controls will be the responsibility of the relevant Accountable Executive/Relationship Manager.

All The Consult must implement this policy but have the freedom to devise their own approach to meeting and evidencing compliance with these requirements.

This Policy only governs how personal information is processed; it does not regulate the use of information about companies. However, such corporate 
information may be covered by local privacy laws or other local internal policies relating to confidentiality and security of information.

3. Privacy Policy Direction

Legal obligations

Privacy Principles

All personal information must be treated with the utmost care and attention whenever and however it is processed by Sina Consult. Where sensitive personal 
information is processed, local laws may impose stricter rules, including increased security, with regards handling this type of information.
The following Privacy Principles are fundamental to us meeting our legal obligations and must be complied with by all The Consult:

Personal information will be processed fairly & lawfully.

This means The Consult must:
. only collect and use personal information where they have lawful grounds and legitimate business reasons to do so; and

. be transparent in their dealings with people as to what information about them they will collect and how they will process their information.
Personal information will only be used for the purposes for which it was originally collected and which the individual was informed about.
This means if The Consult has collected information for a particular purpose they must not use it for anything else until the individuals 
concerned have been informed and, where required, their permission obtained.

. We will only process personal information that is adequate, relevant and not excessive. This means The Consult must:

. not ask for more information than they need for the purposes for which they
are collecting it (even if the information would be useful to know); and

. not record information for the sake of it.
4. We will ensure the personal information we keep is accurate and up to date.

This means The Consult must:

. update their records when an individual informs them that their details have
changed; and

. continuously review and assess the quality of their information.

5. We will only keep personal information for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected.

This means The Consult must:

. comply with local records retention policies and ensure they can justify why
they need to retain each category of personal information; and

. ensure personal information is securely disposed of at the end of the
appropriate period.


6.We will observe the rights afforded to individuals under their local privacy laws, which may include:

. The right to opt-out of receiving marketing communications from Sina Consult Group entities

 . The right to have inaccurate information corrected
 
. The right of access to their information

. The right to prevent processing likely to cause damage or distress

. The right to be informed of how automated decisions have been made. The Consult must ensure that that all queries relating to privacy issues 
are promptly and transparently dealt with in accordance with local legal requirements.

7.We will ensure we have appropriate measures in place to protect personal information from accidental/unauthorised disclosure, theft, damage, 
loss, alteration, etc.

This means The Consult must:

. train their staff on their privacy obligations on a regular basis.

. ensure they have appropriate physical and technological security measures to

protect personal information whether it is on or off-site.

. confidentiality and security policies and guidelines.

. ensure that a secure method of transit is employed whenever personal data is

transferred from one location to another.

. ensure that when they outsource any processes the supplier has appropriate

security measures in place and they will contractually require them to comply with these Privacy Principles.

8. We will ensure that suitable safeguards are in place before personal information is transferred to other countries.

This means The Consult must ensure that any personal information which Sina Consult is responsible for will be adequately 
protected in the country of destination when transferred across border.
